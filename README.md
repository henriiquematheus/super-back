# Supermarket Backend

This project was developed for a university class. The task was to create an app featuring a shopping cart, user account creation, and home page. The project is integrated with the frontend, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and enabling supermarket staff to add, edit, or delete products.


## Key Learnings

The primary challenge revolved around integrating the shopping cart feature due to numerous bugs, as the use of Typescript for the first time. Connecting it with the frontend and JWT posed considerable difficulty. However, this project provided a deeper understanding of these aspects.


## Installation

```bash
  npm i
  npm start dev 
```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you'll need to add the following environment variables to your .env file:

`MONGO_URL=`
